# Ranking Urban Water Supply Plans Using TOPSIS
February 2022

In this project, the TOPSIS method was effectively applied to rank urban water supply methods. We began by transforming qualitative criteria into quantitative data and assembling a decision matrix. The decision matrix was then normalized and weighted, reflecting the importance of various criteria. We considered both benefit and cost criteria, with a focus on maximizing positive attributes and minimizing costs. The normalization process involved converting qualitative assessments into numerical values and scaling them to ensure consistency across different criteria. The weighted decision matrix allowed us to determine the ideal and anti-ideal solutions, from which we calculated the similarity index to rank the alternatives. This structured approach led to identifying the optimal water supply method, which was the construction of a new distribution network and the expansion of existing systems.

This application of the TOPSIS method demonstrated its efficacy in solving complex decision-making problems by providing a clear and systematic ranking of alternatives. The project highlights the importance of integrating quantitative analysis with expert judgment to derive actionable insights. By employing this method, we were able to objectively evaluate and prioritize water supply solutions based on a comprehensive set of criteria, showcasing the method's versatility and effectiveness in urban planning and resource management. The successful implementation of TOPSIS in this context underscores its potential for broader applications in various fields, from infrastructure development to resource allocation.
